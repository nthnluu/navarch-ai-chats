## User

ensure artifacts generated by the simulator are not checked into git

## Assistant

Let me also check the scenario files to see what output filenames are typically configured:

Now I understand the situation. The simulator generates:
- JSON reports (`stress-report-*.json`)
- HTML reports (`stress-report-*.html`)
- Log files (`stress-report-*.log`)

There's already a `stress-report-1000-nodes.json` in the repo root. Let me update the `.gitignore` to ignore simulator artifacts and then remove the existing file from git:

---

## Assistant

Done. I've updated `.gitignore` to ignore simulator-generated artifacts:

```44:48:/Users/nathan/navarch/.gitignore
# Simulator generated artifacts
stress-report*.json
stress-report*.html
stress-report*.log
```

The `stress-report-1000-nodes.json` file in the workspace was already untracked (not committed to git). The new gitignore patterns will prevent any simulator reports from being accidentally added in the future.
